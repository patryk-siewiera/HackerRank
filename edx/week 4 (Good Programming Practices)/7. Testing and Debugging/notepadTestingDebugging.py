"""
week 4 - testing and debugging

- defensive programming
	- write specifications for functions
	- modularize programs
	- check conditions on inputs / outputs (assertions)

- testing
	- compare input / output pairs to specification
	- its not working!
	- how can i break my program? 

- eliminate source of bugs - debugging 
	- study events - leading up to an error
	- why is it not working?
	- how can I fix my program?

CLASS OF TESTS
- from the start, design code to ease this part
- break program into modules that can be tested and debugged individually
- document constraints on modules
	- what do you expect the input to be? the output to be?
- document assumptions behind code design
